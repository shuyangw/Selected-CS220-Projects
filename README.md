# Selected-CS220-Projects
Some noteworthy projects from my programming methodology class
Sudoku:
  Given an input string of length 81 consisiting of digits from 1 to 9 and periods that determine the initial state
  of a sudoku board, this program is able to implement backtracking search and return a solved version of the board in less than a second.
TicTacToe
  Given an input of
    X or O, which determines which player goes next
    An integer that determines the dimension of the board
    A mapping from a tuple (x,y) to X or O which determines the state of the board
  this program implements the minimax algorithm and returns which player will win given that both players play optimally.
